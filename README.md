# AI Career Assistant

An AI-powered career recommendation system that helps users understand which tech roles best match their current skill set and what skills they should learn next.

## Why this project?
Many students learn random skills without knowing how those skills map to real-world roles. This project focuses on **decision intelligence**, not prediction.

## How it works
- User inputs skills in natural language
- TF-IDF converts skills into vectors
- Cosine similarity matches skills to career roles
- Business logic blends skill fit with market growth
- Output shows:
  - Career match confidence
  - Growth outlook
  - Skill gaps

## AI & Product Decisions
- Chose interpretability over complex models
- Avoided job prediction due to lack of real hiring data
- Designed as a decision-support system

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- TF-IDF
- Jupyter Notebook

## Next Steps
- UX improvements
- Bias evaluation
- Experiment design (A/B testing)
